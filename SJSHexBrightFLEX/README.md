HexBright Basic Code - High/Med/Low/Dazzle
_with the hexbright.h library_
  
I am adding more functions found in the hexbright.h to replace the code as possible while keeping the same features and functions.
  
Based on:
Factory firmware for HexBright FLEX v2.4 Dec 6, 2012
https://github.com/hexbright/samples

Cherry picked dazzle improvements from https://github.com/digitalmisery/HexBrightFLEX:
- Changed the way dazzle works and set flicker rate to match the known frequencies for vertigo (about 5 to 20Hz): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_vertigo
- Cherry pick SOS from https://github.com/jaebird/samples.git.
- Added SOS to dazzle mode. To get there press and hold pwr button to get dazzle, then 2 second long press again for SOS
